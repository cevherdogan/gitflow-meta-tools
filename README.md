ðŸ”§ A modular toolkit for automating, managing, and scaling Git-based CI/CD workflows.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This project is built for developers and devops engineers to:
- Automate versioning and changelog management
- Build and share reusable git/CI helpers
- Collaborate on branching, tagging, and release strategies
- Open source a culture of operational GitOps intelligence

## ðŸš€ What's Inside

- `scripts/`: CLI tools like `tag-release.sh` and changelog appenders
- `workflows/`: GitHub Actions, reusable pipelines
- `examples/`: Sample CI logic, git hook usage
- `community/`: Contributor roles and strategy maps

## ðŸ”‚ Dynamic Use Paths

We believe in role-based evolution:
- ðŸ›  Contributors build tools
- ðŸ”­ Strategists propose structure
- ðŸ§ª Testers validate edge use cases

See: [`community/roles.md`](./community/roles.md)

## ðŸš€ Usage Info: Examples

To tag a new release and update logs:

```bash
git add .
./tag-release.sh --help
./tag-release.sh --version 1.2.0
````

Or let the script auto-increment:

```bash
./tag-release.sh --minor
```
